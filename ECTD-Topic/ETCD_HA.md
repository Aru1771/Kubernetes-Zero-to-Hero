one of the MOST important Kubernetes interview topics is 🤯☸️
================================================================
👉 ETCD High Availability (HA)
--------------------------------
Because Kubernetes can survive Pod failures...
But if etcd fails completely 💥 The entire control plane stops working...
That's why production Kubernetes clusters focus heavily on ETCD High Availability 🔥

💡 What is ETCD?
ETCD is a distributed key-value database that stores the entire Kubernetes cluster state.

Think of it as:
🧠 Kubernetes Brain It stores:
 📦 Pods
 🚀 Deployments
 🌐 Services
 🔐 Secrets
 ⚙️ ConfigMaps
 🔑 RBAC Policies

📂 Where is ETCD Data Stored?
----------------------------------
In kubeadm clusters:

       /var/lib/etcd
ETCD database files are stored here by default.

🔐 ETCD Security with TLS Certificates
-------------------------------------------
ETCD communication is encrypted using certificates.
Think:
🪪 Certificate = Identity Card
🔑 Private Key = Password

Important files:

    📄 CA Certificate -- /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
    📄 Server Certificate -- /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
    🔑 Private Key -- /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
 These certificate locations are listed in the TLS section on page 4.

🚀 Final Takeaway
--------------------
Kubernetes availability depends heavily on ETCD reliability.
That's why production clusters focus on:

     🧱 Multi-node ETCD clusters
     🗳️ Raft consensus
     📊 Quorum rules
     📸 Regular backups

Because if ETCD stays healthy...
 ☸️ Kubernetes stays healthy too 🔥
