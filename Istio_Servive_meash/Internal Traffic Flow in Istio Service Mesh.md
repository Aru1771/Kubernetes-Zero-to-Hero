One of the MOST important concepts in Istio is 🚀☸️
👉 Internal Traffic Flow in Istio Service Mesh
Because in a Service Mesh...
Services don't communicate directly.
Every request first passes through an Envoy Sidecar Proxy, where Istio applies routing, security, load balancing, and observability policies automatically. 🔥

💡 What is Internal Traffic in Istio?
Internal traffic refers to service-to-service communication inside a Kubernetes cluster.
Unlike traditional Kubernetes networking:
Service A ─────────► Service B
In Istio, the traffic flows through Envoy sidecars:
Service A
 │
 ▼
Envoy Proxy
 │
 ▼
Envoy Proxy
 │
 ▼
Service B
This allows Istio to control all communication without changing application code.

Easy Analogy :
Imagine two employees in a company.
Without Istio:
👤 Employee A ➜ Employee B
Direct communication.
With Istio:
👤 Employee A
⬇️
🛡️ Security Desk
⬇️
👤 Employee B
The security desk checks every request before it reaches the destination.
That's exactly how Envoy Sidecars work.

🚀 Every Pod Gets an Envoy Sidecar
Each application Pod contains:
Pod
├── Application Container
└── Envoy Sidecar Proxy
The Envoy sidecar intercepts all:
📤 Outgoing Traffic
📥 Incoming Traffic
No application code changes are required.

🚦Istio supports powerful routing capabilities:
🐤 Canary Deployments
🟦🟩 Blue-Green Deployments
⚖️ Traffic Splitting
🔁 Retry Policies
⏱️ Timeouts
💥 Circuit Breaking
🧪 Fault Injection
All without modifying application code.

🎯 One-Line Interview Answer
👉 Istio manages internal service-to-service communication using Envoy sidecar proxies that intercept all incoming and outgoing traffic, providing secure mTLS communication, intelligent traffic routing, automatic load balancing, retries, circuit breaking, and observability without changing application code.

🚀 Final Takeaway
Applications should focus on business logic...
Not networking.
Istio moves networking responsibilities into the infrastructure layer by providing:
🔒 Secure communication with mTLS
⚖️ Intelligent load balancing
🚦 Advanced traffic management
📊 Deep observability
💥 Built-in resilience with retries and circuit breaking
This makes Kubernetes microservices more secure, reliable, and easier to operate at scale. 🔥☸️
