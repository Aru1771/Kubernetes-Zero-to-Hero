One of the MOST common Kubernetes interview topics is 🚀☸️
👉 Istio Traffic Flow on AWS EKS
Many engineers know what Istio is...
But during interviews they're often asked:
❓ How does traffic actually flow through an Istio Service Mesh on Amazon EKS?
Understanding the end-to-end traffic flow helps you understand how Istio manages routing, security, and observability in production environments. 🔥

💡 What Happens When a User Sends a Request?
Imagine a user opening:
https://shop.example.com
The request doesn't go directly to the application.
Instead, it passes through several layers.
🌐 End-to-End Architecture
External User
 │
 ▼
AWS Load Balancer (ALB / NLB)
 │
 ▼
Istio Ingress Gateway (Envoy)
 │
 ▼
Istio Service Mesh (Envoy Sidecars)
 │
 ▼
Kubernetes Microservices
Every request flows through this path before reaching your application.

🚀 Final Takeaway
With Istio on AWS EKS:
🌐 AWS Load Balancer handles external access
🚪 Istio Ingress Gateway receives requests
🧭 Gateway & VirtualService decide routing
📦 Envoy Sidecars manage all internal communication
🔒 mTLS secures every service call
📊 Kiali, Prometheus, and Jaeger provide complete observability
The result is a secure, reliable, and highly manageable microservices platform—without changing your application code. 🔥☸️
