The important thing is to understand that kubeadm itself does not provide node autoscaling. 
================
You add an autoscaler around your kubeadm cluster. Kubernetes' current documentation describes Cluster Autoscaler as a node autoscaler that adds/removes nodes based on scheduling capacity.

Your architecture
-----------------
For your setup, I recommend this architecture:

                         AWS
                          |
                  EC2 Auto Scaling Group
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |                       |
          Worker-1                Worker-2
              |                       |
              +-----------+-----------+
                          |
                     Kubernetes
                          |
                    kubeadm cluster
                          |
                       kubelet
                          |
                     containerd
                          |
                         runc

Then add:

                    Cluster Autoscaler
                           |
                           ↓
                    AWS Auto Scaling
                           |
                           ↓
                    EC2 Worker Nodes

So the complete flow becomes:

      Pending Pod
          |
          ↓
      Kubernetes Scheduler
          |
          | "No worker has enough capacity"
          ↓
      Cluster Autoscaler
          |
          ↓
      AWS Auto Scaling Group
          |
          ↓
      Launch EC2 instance
          |
          ↓
      EC2 User Data
          |
          ↓
      kubeadm join
          |
          ↓
      New Worker Node
          |
          ↓
      Pending Pod gets scheduled
      
   The AWS Cluster Autoscaler implementation specifically uses EC2 Auto Scaling Groups as node groups.


1. Don't confuse two different autoscaling mechanisms
   ---------------------------------------------------
You may hear:

HPA

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:

High CPU
   ↓
More Pods
   ↓
Pod count increases

Example:

3 Pods → 6 Pods
Cluster Autoscaler

Node autoscaling:

Pods cannot fit
       ↓
Add EC2 worker
       ↓
New Kubernetes Node

Example:

2 Nodes → 3 Nodes

You can use both together:

Application traffic increases
          ↓
         HPA
          ↓
More Pods
          ↓
Pods cannot fit on existing nodes
          ↓
Cluster Autoscaler
          ↓
AWS ASG
          ↓
New EC2 worker

This is the common pattern for workload + node autoscaling.

2. What you need to create
   ------------------------
For your kubeadm-on-EC2 cluster, you need roughly these components:

      AWS side
      EC2 Launch Template
              ↓
      Auto Scaling Group
              ↓
      Worker EC2 instances
      
      For example:
      
      ASG: kubeadm-workers
      
      
      min = 2
      desired = 2
      max = 5
      
      Initially:
      
      Worker-1
      Worker-2
      
      Maximum:
      
      Worker-1
      Worker-2
      Worker-3
      Worker-4
      Worker-5

3. The most important part: kubeadm join
   -------------------------------------

This is where kubeadm differs from EKS.

When AWS creates a new EC2 instance, AWS doesn't automatically know:

"This EC2 instance should become a Kubernetes worker."

You need to bootstrap it.

The new EC2 needs:

containerd
kubelet
kubeadm

and then:

kubeadm join <control-plane>:6443 ...

Kubernetes' kubeadm documentation confirms that each new Linux worker needs kubeadm, kubelet and a container runtime, followed by kubeadm join.

Therefore your EC2 Launch Template/User Data is extremely important.

Conceptually:
      #!/bin/bash
      
      # Install containerd
      # Install kubeadm
      # Install kubelet
      
      # Configure containerd
      # Disable swap
      
      # Join cluster
      kubeadm join <CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:6443 \
        --token XXXXX \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:XXXXX

Then:

    ASG launches EC2
           ↓
    User Data executes
           ↓
    Install Kubernetes components
           ↓
    kubeadm join
           ↓
    Node appears in:
    kubectl get nodes

4. Then install Cluster Autoscaler
   --------------------------------
The Cluster Autoscaler runs inside your Kubernetes cluster, normally as a Deployment. On AWS it communicates with the AWS Auto Scaling API to change the desired capacity of the ASG.

For example:

                  Kubernetes
                      |
                      |
             Cluster Autoscaler
                      |
                      ↓
              AWS API
                      |
                      ↓
            Auto Scaling Group
                      |
             +--------+--------+
             |                 |
          EC2 Node          EC2 Node

5. How scale-up actually happens
   -------------------------------
   Suppose you currently have:

ASG:


min = 2
desired = 2
max = 5

And:

Node-1
Node-2

Now you deploy a workload requiring more resources:

Pod A
Pod B
Pod C
Pod D
Pod E
Pod F

Suppose:

Node-1 → full
Node-2 → full

Some Pods become:

Pending

The Cluster Autoscaler sees:

Pending Pods
      ↓
Insufficient node capacity

Then:

Cluster Autoscaler
       ↓
AWS ASG desired capacity
2 → 3
       ↓
AWS launches EC2
       ↓
User Data
       ↓
kubeadm join
       ↓
Node-3
       ↓
Scheduler
       ↓
Pending Pods → Node-3

That's the complete scale-up flow.


6. How scale-down works
    --------------------

   Now imagine the workload decreases.

Node-1 → 20%
Node-2 → 15%
Node-3 → 5%

If a node remains unnecessary for the configured scale-down conditions, Cluster Autoscaler can choose a node to remove.

The process is approximately:

Cluster Autoscaler
       ↓
Find unnecessary node
       ↓
Cordon/drain
       ↓
Pods move elsewhere
       ↓
Terminate EC2
       ↓
ASG desired capacity decreases

The AWS Cluster Autoscaler respects the ASG's configured minimum and maximum and adjusts the desired capacity within those bounds.

7. Very important: ASG alone is NOT enough
   --------------------------------------
   This is a common interview question.

If you only create:

EC2 Auto Scaling Group

AWS might launch:

Worker-1
Worker-2
Worker-3

But Kubernetes won't necessarily know what to do with Worker-3.

You need the new EC2 to automatically execute:

kubeadm join

And you need Cluster Autoscaler to decide when the ASG should increase/decrease.
So:

ASG alone
❌ Not Kubernetes-aware

Whereas:

Cluster Autoscaler
        +
AWS ASG
        +
EC2 bootstrap/kubeadm join

gives you Kubernetes node autoscaling.

8. AWS IAM is also required
   --------------------------
Cluster Autoscaler needs permission to inspect and modify your Auto Scaling Groups.

For example, it needs permissions such as:

autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups
autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances
autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities
autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity
autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup

The official AWS Cluster Autoscaler documentation recommends restricting those permissions to the appropriate ASGs rather than giving unnecessarily broad access.

9. How I would build your lab
   ----------------------------
Since you're learning AWS + Kubernetes + kubeadm, I recommend doing it in this order:

Phase 1 — Normal kubeadm cluster
1 Control Plane
      +
2 Workers

Verify:

kubectl get nodes
Phase 2 — Create AWS Launch Template

The Launch Template should contain:

AMI
Instance type
Security Group
IAM instance profile
User Data

User Data prepares the machine and performs:

kubeadm join
Phase 3 — Create ASG

For example:

Minimum: 2
Desired: 2
Maximum: 5

Now your two existing workers should ideally be managed consistently by that node group, or you can rebuild them from the Launch Template so the entire worker pool is homogeneous.

Phase 4 — Add Cluster Autoscaler

Configure:

AWS provider
+
ASG autodiscovery
+
IAM permissions

AWS's recommended Cluster Autoscaler configuration uses ASG tags for autodiscovery, for example:

k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled
k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/<cluster-name>

The autoscaler uses those tags to discover the ASGs it should manage.

Phase 5 — Test scale-up

Deploy a workload that cannot fit:

Pods → Pending

Then watch:

kubectl get nodes -w

You should see:

worker-1   Ready
worker-2   Ready
worker-3   Ready

And in AWS:

ASG


Desired:
2 → 3
Phase 6 — Test scale-down

Reduce/delete the workload.

Then:

Pods decrease
     ↓
Node becomes unnecessary
     ↓
Cluster Autoscaler
     ↓
Node drained
     ↓
EC2 terminated
     ↓
2 workers remain
The architecture you should remember

For your AWS + kubeadm environment:

                         AWS
                          |
                    Auto Scaling Group
                    min=2 max=5
                          |
             +------------+------------+
             |                         |
          EC2 Worker                EC2 Worker
             |                         |
          kubelet                   kubelet
             |                         |
        containerd                containerd
             |                         |
           runc                      runc
             |                         |
             +------------+------------+
                          |
                    Kubernetes API
                          |
                  Cluster Autoscaler
                          |
                          ↓
                     AWS ASG API

The most important concept is:

Cluster Autoscaler doesn't create Kubernetes nodes directly. 
It changes the desired capacity of the AWS Auto Scaling Group. 
AWS launches the EC2 instance, the instance bootstraps itself and runs kubeadm join, and then Kubernetes sees it as a new worker node.

That is the architecture I recommend you implement for your kubeadm cluster.
