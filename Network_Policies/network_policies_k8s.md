One of the MOST important Kubernetes security features is 🔐☸️
👉 NetworkPolicy
Because by default Kubernetes networking is very open.
Without any NetworkPolicy:
Pod A ───► Pod B ✅
Pod B ───► Pod C ✅
Pod C ───► Pod A ✅
Every Pod can communicate with every other Pod.
Sounds convenient...
But in production, it's a security risk 🚨

💡 What is a NetworkPolicy?
A NetworkPolicy is a Kubernetes resource used to control network traffic between Pods.
Think of it as:
🔥 Firewall for Pods
It allows you to control:
📥 Ingress (Incoming Traffic)
📤 Egress (Outgoing Traffic)

💡 Easy Analogy
Imagine an office building 🏢
Without security:
🚶 Anyone can enter any room
🚶 Anyone can leave and access any area
With security guards:
✅ Only authorized people can enter
✅ Only approved destinations can be reached
That's exactly what NetworkPolicy does.

☁️ NetworkPolicy in Amazon EKS
 ✅ Latest Amazon VPC CNI supports NetworkPolicies natively in EKS.

💡 Quick Revision
🔥 NetworkPolicy → Pod Firewall
📥 Ingress → Incoming Traffic
📤 Egress → Outgoing Traffic
🚫 Deny-All → Zero Trust Foundation
🎯 podSelector → Select Pods
🏷 namespaceSelector → Select Namespace
☁️ Modern EKS VPC CNI → Native NetworkPolicy Support
🔐 Best Practice → Deny All First, Then Allow Required Traffic

🎯 One-Line Interview Answer
👉 NetworkPolicy is a Kubernetes resource that controls Pod-to-Pod communication by defining ingress and egress rules, enabling microservice isolation, zero-trust networking, and least-privilege security.
