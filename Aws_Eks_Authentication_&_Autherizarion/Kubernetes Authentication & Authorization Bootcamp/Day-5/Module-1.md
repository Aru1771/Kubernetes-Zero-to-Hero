Module 1: How RBAC Evaluation Actually Works
==============================================

Let's first understand what happens when a request reaches the API server.
Suppose a developer runs:

kubectl delete pod nginx

The flow looks like this:

kubectl delete pod nginx
        │
        ▼
Authentication
        │
        ▼
User Identity = dev-user
        │
        ▼
Authorization (RBAC)

Find all RoleBindings
        │
        ▼
Find all ClusterRoleBindings
        │
        ▼
Collect all Roles & ClusterRoles
        │
        ▼
Merge all permissions
        │
        ▼
Is delete on pods allowed?

YES → Execute
NO  → 403 Forbidden
Important Rule

RBAC does not stop at the first RoleBinding.

It collects permissions from every applicable RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding, then combines them.

Think of it as a union of permissions.

Example:

Role A

get pods

-----------------

Role B

create deployment

-----------------

Effective Permissions

get pods
create deployment

Permissions are added together.
