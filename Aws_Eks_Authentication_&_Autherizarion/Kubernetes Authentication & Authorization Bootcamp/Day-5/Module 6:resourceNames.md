What problem does resourceNames solve?
=============================================
Normally, if a user has permission to read ConfigMaps, they can read every ConfigMap in the namespace.

Example:

kubectl get configmaps

RBAC:

resources:
- configmaps

verbs:
- get

Result:

config1
config2
config3
database-config
secret-config

Sometimes you don't want that.

You only want the user to access one specific resource.
--------------------------------------------------------
This is where resourceNames is used.

Example

Suppose your application has:

ConfigMaps

database-config
application-config
redis-config
nginx-config

Your application should only read:

database-config

RBAC:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role

metadata:
  name: app-reader
  namespace: production

rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
  - configmaps

  resourceNames:
  - database-config

  verbs:
  - get

Now:

kubectl get configmap database-config

✅ Allowed

But:

kubectl get configmap redis-config

❌ Forbidden

Where is it used?

Production examples:

One application should read only its own ConfigMap.
One Job should update only one Secret.
Backup tool can access only one PVC.
Monitoring tool can read only one Lease object.

This is an important least-privilege feature.
