Module 7: Non-Resource URLs
=====================
Not everything in Kubernetes is a resource like Pods or Deployments.

Some API endpoints are URLs.

Examples:

/healthz
/version
/metrics
/livez
/readyz
/openapi

To control access to these endpoints, use nonResourceURLs.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Example:

rules:
- nonResourceURLs:
  - /healthz
  verbs:
  - get

This allows:

kubectl get --raw /healthz

but not access to other URLs.

Production Use Case
------------------
Monitoring systems like Prometheus may need to scrape:

/metrics

You can grant only:

rules:
- nonResourceURLs:
  - /metrics
  verbs:
  - get

instead of broader API access.
